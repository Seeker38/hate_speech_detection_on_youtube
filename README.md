# Vietnamese Hate Speech Detection on Youtube using PhoBERT-CNN; CNN-BiLSTM; BiLSTM and Logistic Regression
THis repository aim to create a website that can dectect and let users have chances to deal with different type of comments on youtube:
- Clean
- Offensive
- Hate

This is a repository re-implementing the code of the paper ```Vietnamese-Hate-and-Offensive-Detection-using-PhoBERT-CNN-and-Social-Media-Streaming-Data```  for Data Mining final project

# Installation
### for model
- Install necessary packages from requirements.txt file
```bash
    pip install -r HateSpeechDetectionApp/requirements.txt
```

- Set up kafka cluster locally: please refer to this document https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart#quickstart_startserver

- Create topic for data storage (run this code in the kafka path you have just set up): 
```bash
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic rawData  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic anomalies  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```
### for website
###### Part 1: Prepare the Environment

1.1. Install Visual Studio Code:

- Visit the official Visual Studio Code page: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Download and install Visual Studio Code with your computer's compatible operating system.

1.2. Install Node.js and npm:

- Visit the official Node.js page: https://nodejs.org
- Download and install Node.js and npm.
- Check if Node.js is installed with the command
```bash
    node –v
```
1.3. Install Kafka:
- Visit the Apache Kafka homepage (https://kafka.apache.org/downloads) to download the version of Kafka you want to install. Choose the version suitable for your operating system.

###### Part 2: Install libraries for reactjs:

2.1. Create a website using npm
- Go to the folder you want to put the website in
- Open terminal and type: 
```bash
    npx create-react-app ${Name of the website you want}
```

2.2. Unzip the source code files
- Move the 2 files src and server file into the web folder you just created (overwrite the original file)
- Move the **final** file to a separate folder (It's best to keep it in drive D so you don't need to change the path inside the file)

2.3. Install libraries for ReactJS:
- Go to the server directory and open terminal and type:

```bash
pip install Flask pymongo requests google-api-python-client beautifulsoup4
npm install express cors
```

- Go to the main directory of the website, open terminal and type:

```bash
npm install react recharts axios react-icons qrcode.react react-spinners
```

###### Part 3: Install API for YouTube (For your YouTube account)

- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), go to APIs and services and create a new project
- Go to the OAuth consent screen and create a new External server
- Go to the Identifiants section in Create IDs to create an API key and an OAuth client ID
- Go to Library to find Youtube Data API v3 and start it
- Finally, go into the Flask.py file (in the server) and the producer.py file (in **final** folder) change the value of Developer_Key with the new API key and change the path of Client_secret_life (in reject_comment.py) with the path of the file OAuth client ID

###### Part 4: Start the Web

4.1. Start the Zookeeper server
```bash
.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1--partition 1 --topic “topic_name”
```

4.2. Start Consumer

Run file consumer.py

4.3. Launch Web

• Open a terminal in the server folder and type: node server.js
• Open a terminal in the server folder and type: python FlaskP.py
• Open a terminal in the main web folder and type: 
```bash
npm start
```
